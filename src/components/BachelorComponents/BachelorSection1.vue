        Pursuing a minor alongside a major can significantly enhance a student’s academic and professional
        profile. At Richmond, students can choose from 24 diverse minors, allowing them to tailor their
        education to their interests and career goals. This flexibility broadens their knowledge base and
        enables them to develop a unique combination of skills. For instance, a political science major
        student might opt for a minor in communications, enhancing their ability to convey complex ideas
        effectively. Such combinations make graduates more versatile and attractive to employers, as they
        bring a broader perspective and a more diverse skill set to their professional roles.
