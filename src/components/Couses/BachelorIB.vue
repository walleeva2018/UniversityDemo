        <h2>About the BA (Hons) Business Management: International Business Programme</h2>
        <p>Are you interested in making an impact in the business world? Gain the knowledge and skills you need to
            succeed in management in an increasingly global business environment with this programme, which will take
            you from new student to future business leader.</p>

        <p>The journey begins from day one. As finance, socio-economic factors, politics, geography, language, and
            culture all influence business, you’ll begin the programme with an exploration of how these can help shape
            business strategy within an international marketplace.</p>

        <p>Like our other undergraduate programmes at Prieston, this BA is based on the American liberal arts tradition,
            which helps broaden perspective and develops practical skills that are highly appealing to future employers
            in a global economy.</p>

        <p>The vibrancy of London provides the ideal backdrop to study this subject – it’s the home of big business and
            entrepreneurial start-ups.</p>

        <p>Renowned and highly qualified business leaders are invited to speak to our BA International Business
            students, sharing their experience within the industry, while visits to organisations and events enhance
            experiential learning.</p>

        <p>You’ll also be able to tailor your International Business degree by taking a minor from a wide range of other
            leading academic disciplines.</p>

        <p>Many of our students gain international industry experience through an accredited internship, which helps
            shape their education and career choice.</p>

        <p>You will have the opportunity to develop your entrepreneurial spirit through Matrix, a multi-disciplinary
            platform for students to seek guidance, test their ideas, and develop their curiosity about launching their
            own business.</p>

        <p>Matrix has a core team including faculty, students, staff, and alumni organizing events and workshops for
            current Prieston students.</p>

        <p>On completing this programme, students will be able to apply for four exemptions (all certificate level) from
            The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), the world’s largest professional body of
            management accountants, entering into their Operational Level.</p>
