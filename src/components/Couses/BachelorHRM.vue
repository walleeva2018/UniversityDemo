            degree is designed to equip you with all the skills and knowledge you need to run your own business from
            inception to implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beginning with the principles of Business Management, you’ll consider how finance, socio-economic factors,
            politics, geography, language, and culture all influence business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Study entrepreneurship as a pathway of your BA Business Management which will give you a solid understanding
            of the dynamic field of business and enhance your chances of success as an entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’ve also got the option of tailoring your study of entrepreneurship by taking minors from other leading
            academic disciplines.

        <p>
            The vibrancy of London provides the ideal backdrop to study this subject – it’s the home of big business and
            entrepreneurial start-ups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taught by lecturers who are experts in their field, this programme also features entrepreneurs as guest
            speakers, while visits to organisations and events extend your perspective and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            An internship which counts towards your degree is a fantastic opportunity to enhance your entrepreneurship
            skills and improve your career options.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will have the opportunity to develop your entrepreneurial spirit through Matrix, a multi-disciplinary
            platform for students to seek guidance, test their ideas, and develop their curiosity of launching their own
