            <h2>BA (Hons) Communications: Advertising & Public Relations</h2>
            <p>From “Wassup!” to “Just do it,” the most successful ads have a way of ingraining themselves in your
                memory. Remember the #icebucketchallenge? This viral sensation is one of the most successful PR
                campaigns ever, achieving global online awareness and raising millions for the ALS Association.</p>

            <p>If you would like to create campaigns like these and more, this programme will give you the practical
                know-how and equip you for a successful career in either advertising or PR.</p>

            <p>For this programme, it’s vital to have a grounding in the principles of communication. During the first
                two years of the degree, all Communications students at Prieston take the same core courses.</p>

            <p>With our inter-disciplinary approach, you’ll explore topics involving communication, such as business,
                sociology, and visual culture, as well as studying the principles of marketing and PR and
                self-representation in the media. Small class sizes with an international cohort of students will give
                you a broad perspective. You’ll have the opportunity to listen to guest lecturers from the
                communications industry, providing their views on the latest trends and innovations.</p>

            <p>The third and fourth years of this programme are devoted to more specialization in Advertising and Public
                Relations, with the option to choose electives from an array of exciting topics, including Celebrity,
                Fan Culture and the Media, the Psychology of Fashion and Luxury Goods, and Advanced Digital Video.</p>

            <p>Not only that, but you’ll also have the opportunity to put your ideas into practice by pursuing an
                internship with a leading communications company or global organization.</p>

            <p>Through our partnership with them, you’ll have membership of The Public Relations and Communications
                Association (PRCA) – Europe’s largest and most influential PR and communications membership body, which
                organizes training, conferences, and events for communications professionals.</p>

            <p>It’s a career-oriented programme, giving you a clear foundation in both theory and practice, taught in
                London – one of the world’s most important centres for advertising and public relations.</p>

            <p>Like all Prieston graduates, you’ll also be able to qualify with two degrees – one from the UK and one
                from the US.</p>
