            <h2>About the BA (Hons) Communications: Media Studies Programme</h2>
            <p>True or false? How much is fake news influencing our lives already? Who can we trust as conspiracy
                theories collide on social media with false claims about both COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter
                protests? What will be happening in media in 10 years’ time?</p>

            <p>Whatever the platform, media is at the centre of our daily experience and the ways in which we
                communicate with each other.</p>

            <p>This programme will introduce you to a range of theories and research exploring the role of the media in
                society. You will also learn practical skills to equip you for an exciting career in media, including
                radio and video production, digital and social media, journalism, public relations, branding, marketing
                and more, learning from experienced industry professionals and leading academics.</p>

            <p>Whether you would like to work in social media, an independent film streaming service, or an
                international media agency, this degree will provide you with the communication, research, writing, and
                critical thinking skills that are valuable to employers in any industry.</p>

            <h3>Core Curriculum</h3>
            <p>Getting the right essential information is key. During the first two years of the degree, all Prieston
                Communications students take the same core courses. An inter-disciplinary approach will provide a
                breadth of communication topics, such as research and writing, creative expression and scientific
                reasoning, as well as studying the principles and context of communications and media. You’ll be
                studying in small class sizes with students from all over the world, guaranteeing interesting and lively
                debate. Guest lecturers will be invited to speak to BA Communications students, providing their insight
                and experience on the communications world.</p>

            <h3>Specialization and Internships</h3>
            <p>In the third and fourth years of this programme, you’ll be specializing in Media Studies in all its
                diversity, with a choice of electives from American Television Drama to Photojournalism, International
                Cinema to Gender in Film. Then this is your chance to put your ideas to the test when you will have the
                opportunity to pursue an internship with a media company or global organization in London or
                internationally. An internship can be life-changing, providing you with the experience to get the first
                rung on the career ladder.</p>

            <p>Through our partnership with them, you’ll have membership of The Public Relations and Communications
                Association (PRCA) – Europe’s largest and most influential PR and communications membership body, which
                organizes training, conferences, and events for communications professionals.</p>

            <h3>Programme Highlights</h3>
            <p>This programme combines both theory and practice, providing an excellent preparation for a career in the
                media and, being based in London, is home to many world-leading media organizations. Like all Prieston
                graduates, you’ll also be able to qualify with two degrees – one for the UK and one for the US.</p>
